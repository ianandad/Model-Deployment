# Model Deployment in AWS Using WinSCP and PuTTY

This repository provides step-by-step instructions and resources for deploying a machine learning model in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment using WinSCP and PuTTY. These tools will allow you to transfer your model files to an AWS instance and interact with it securely through SSH.

## Introduction

Deploying a machine learning model in an AWS environment is a common practice for scalable and robust applications. To facilitate this deployment, you will need to use WinSCP and PuTTY, two popular Windows-based tools. WinSCP allows you to securely transfer files to your AWS instance, while PuTTY enables you to connect to the instance using SSH.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up an AWS instance, installing and configuring WinSCP and PuTTY, transferring your model files to the instance, and running inference on the AWS instance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage EC2 instances.
- AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
- A machine learning model you want to deploy, along with any dependencies.
- Windows OS on your local machine.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create an AWS Instance

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. Click "Launch Instance" and select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your needs (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu).
4. Configure the instance type, security groups, and other settings.
5. Launch the instance and create a key pair if you don't already have one.

### Step 2: Install WinSCP

1. Download and install WinSCP from [https://winscp.net/](https://winscp.net/).
2. Launch WinSCP and configure your AWS instance as a new session, specifying your instance's IP address, username (usually "ec2-user" for Amazon Linux or "ubuntu" for Ubuntu), and private key file (your .pem file).

### Step 3: Install PuTTY

1. Download and install PuTTY from [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).
2. Use PuTTYgen to convert your .pem key pair file to a .ppk file for PuTTY.

### Step 4: Connect to the AWS Instance

1. Open PuTTY and configure the session with your instance's IP address.
2. In the "Connection" category, go to "SSH" and select "Auth." Browse for your .ppk private key file.
3. Click "Open" to connect to your AWS instance using SSH.

### Step 5: Transfer Model Files with WinSCP

1. In WinSCP, connect to your AWS instance.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to upload your model files on the AWS instance.
3. Use the drag-and-drop interface in WinSCP to upload your model files.

### Step 6: Run Inference on the AWS Instance

1. Back in PuTTY, navigate to the directory where you uploaded your model files.
2. Execute your machine learning model on the AWS instance.
